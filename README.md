**Synopsis:** This script was used for sorting and moving personal files, especially the images, to specific date taken folders. Later I thought to share the script with others, which might help others move their files date wise. No special requirements are needed. Only run the PowerShell script file, provide Source Path and the Output / Destination Path or the folder locations, and it will move all of the files to the target directory with date wise folders.

You can also choose the Source and Destination path to the same location. The script will only provide a warning for the same path location. But it will work fine.
